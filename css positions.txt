static is default
tells the element to follow whatever comes next

relative 
allows you to change top,bottom,left,right relative where it normally statically
in general u dont use top,bottom,left,right 

absolute
always used with top,bottom,left,right
absolute moves it from top of the screen
because it removes it from the document flow

parent uses relative 
so that children uses it as it's position

fixed is similar to absolute
fixed is based on the html 
they stay ontop no matter

sticky is relative and fixed position together
good for making nav bars.
it stays relative intill you scroll down
then it becomes fixed
